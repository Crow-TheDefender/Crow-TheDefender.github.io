Hi!

I'm Crow (it's been by nickname since I started gaming and playing football (as a defender)).

I'm a Cyber Security Analyst. My key focus in my current role is around the defensive side of Cyber Security (Digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) & Threat Hunting). However I have an interest in Open source intelligence (OSINT), Cyberthreat Intelligence (CTI), Capture the Flags (CtFs) and Malware analysis. My current work place is encouraging us to write more about our experiences and things we learn along the way, so I thought I would start this blog.

As you can probably guess I am not great at coming up with names which is why this site is called Crow - The Defender.
